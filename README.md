### Motivation

In our house, we currently charge all our devices in one place, and there aren't enough power outlets. This UPS also acts as backup power in case of an outage, so we can still charge our devices for long after the power is out.

#### The Custom Ideal Diode Module (5x) - Order Total (for 5x): $29.12

Check the [ideal diode folder](https://github.com/lekangji/MacroUPS/tree/main/Ideal%20Diode) for specific BOM, gerber, pickandplace, as well as source files + images.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a folder named `DONOTUSE` with the old versions. The mosfet is the wrong direction in those versions, so please don't use them unless you like expensive paperweights.

Motivation:

- Almost all cheap ideal diode modules commonly found on AliExpress use the XL74610. However, it has voltage drops every half-second because it is groundless and must recharge its capacitor. This is bad for my application, since it would cause voltage fluctuations and constant switching between battery and mains.
- Handles **30a** with big heatsinks on both sides and maybe a thicker copper pour or copper wires on VIN and VOUT)
- Voltage range is up to **40V** limited by the MOSFET.
- 125 C max operating temperature (by components minimum temp), but please keep it cooler than that.
